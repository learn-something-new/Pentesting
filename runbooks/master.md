  - Run against TCP and UDP with the summary flag 
- Run [Searchsploit](https://github.com/obihann/pentesting-things/blob/master/cheatsheets/tools/searchsploit.md)
  - Run with the --colour (so no colour is displayed) and --nmap flag targeting the XML files from AutoRecons full TCP and top-25 UDP scans, combine both into a single file
  - If no results run again with the verbose flag
- Run EyeWitness against [Gobuster](https://github.com/obihann/pentesting-things/blob/master/cheatsheets/tools/gobuster.md) results generated from AutoRecon
  - View source and look for links, JS files, etc.
