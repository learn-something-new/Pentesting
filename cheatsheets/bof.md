# Buffer Overflows

## Terms
- DEP: Data execution prevention
- ASLR: Address space layout randomization
- ESP: Stack pointer
- Payload: Compiled or packaged shellcode and related data
- Shellcode: Exploitation code
- EIP: Instructional pointer

## Steps
- Fuzzing: Send data with increasing sizes until the application crashes, identify the max size
- Binary Tree Analysis: Manually or with Metasploit send payloads (of the max size discovered earlier) to identify where the EIP is changed
- Offset: Send a unique value at the offset and verify it appears in the debugger 
- Buffer Size: By using previous test to identify the max size for your payload, increase the payload in your test until the full size is no longer displayed in the debugger
- Bad Characters: Manually or with Metasploit identify characters that the buffer can not handle
- Return Address: Find a DLL not effected by memory protection then identify a perminent address
- Shellcode: Generate your shellcode to fit within the buffer size, avoid bad characters and always check your encoding
